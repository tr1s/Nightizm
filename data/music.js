      <p>I had so much fun making these. This was my take on DJing "chopped and screwed" or "slowed" tracks. Slightly pitched down, then had fun on the decks chopping it up live with effects and such. Back for you to enjoy ðŸ–¤ðŸŒ™</p>

      <p>Most tracks are pretty accurate in terms of the time they were created, apart from Police Brutality. That was released recently, but created circa 2014. Plus there's one bonus that I don't think I ever released, but it felt like it belonged here.</p>
